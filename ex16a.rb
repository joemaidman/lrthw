# File commands:
# close -> closes a File
# read -> read the contents of a File
# readline -> read one line of text
# truncate -> Empties a file, use with care!!!
# write('something') -> write something to the file
# --> the open command takes a 'w' to indicate we want to write to the file. Note that 'w' overwrites the contents!!
# ---> can also use 'a' for append and 'r' for read
