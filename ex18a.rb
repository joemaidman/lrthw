# Functions checklist:
# 1) Start with 'def'
# 2) name should start with a letter and can contain letters, numbers of underscores
# 3) puts arguments inside ()
# 4) arguments need unique names
# 5) indent the lines inside the function by two spaces
# 6) end the function with 'end'
# 7) Functions that don't take any arguments don't need to be called with (), but it may make sense to include them fro readability.
# 8) Can return things from it with the return keyword or it will just return the last expression anyway
